
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) 
Statement:
1.  No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. 

2.  We can define it in another way. An interface should be more closly related to the code that uses it than code that implements it.
	So the methods on the interface are defined by which methods the client code needs than which methods the class implements. 
	So clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.
    Like classes, each interface should have a specific purpose/responsibility (refer to SRP).
	You shouldn't be forced to implement an interface when your object doesn't share that purpose. 
	The larger the interface, the more likely it includes methods that not all implementers can do. That's the essence of the Interface Segregation Principle.
