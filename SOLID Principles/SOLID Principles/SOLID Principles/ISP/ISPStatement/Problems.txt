Suppose we need to build a system for an IT firm that contains roles like TeamLead and Programmer
 where TeamLead divides a huge task into smaller tasks and assigns them to his/her programmers or can directly work on them.
 Based on specifications, we need to create an interface and a TeamLead class to implement it. 
 Later another role like Manager, who assigns tasks to TeamLead and will not work on the tasks, is introduced into the system. 
 Can we directly implement an ILead interface in the Manager class


 Problem in the Design that voilates ISP 
     Since the Manager can't work on a task and at the same time no one can assign tasks to the Manager, this WorkOnTask() should not be in the Manager class.
      But we are implementing this class from the ILead interface, we need to provide a concrete Method.
      Here we are forcing the Manager class to implement a WorkOnTask() method without a purpose. This is wrong. The design violates ISP. 
      Let's correct the design.
